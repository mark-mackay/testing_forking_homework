# Overnumerousness with calendar
This lab was to test our testing based approach and collaboration using simple calculations with predictable return values.

### Assumptions
For the most part it was assumed that the correct type of values were given for each of the functions/methods, it was also assumed that accuracy was only required to one decimal place although this can be amended to suit clarified requirements.

# Functions/Methods
### return_10()
  	function/method to return 10 
  
  Description: accepts no parameters, returns the number 10.
  
  
### add(num1, num2)
  	function/method to add two numbers assumes numeric
    
   Description: accepts two numeric parameters, returns the sum.
    
### subtract(num1, num2)
  	function/method to subtract two numbers assumes numeric
  
  Description: accepts two numeric parameters, returns the first minus the second.
### multiply(num1, num2)
  	function/method to multiply two numbers assumes numeric
  
  Description: accepts two numeric parameters, returns the first times the second.
### divide(num1, num2)
  	function/method to divide two numbers assumes numeric, checks for division by zero
  
  Description: accepts two numeric parameters, returns the first divided by the second, checks for division by zero.
  
### length_of_string(test_string)
  	function/method to return string length
  
  Description: method that accepts a string and returns its length as a numeric
  
### join_string(string_1, string_2)
  	function/method to concatinate two strings
  
  Description: Accepts two strings and returns another string concatinated.
 
### add_string_as_number(string_1, string_2)
 	function/method to add two numbers after converting them from strings assumes numeric
  
  Description: Accepts two strings, converts them to numeric, adds them and returns the numeric, assumes correct input given
  
### def number_to_full_month_name(number)
	function/method to return full month name when given month number, assumes numeric
  
  Description: Accepts a numeric parameter referencing the month and returns the full string name of the Month, assumes correct input provided.
  
### number_to_short_month_name(number)
	function/method to return short month name when given month number, assumes numeric
  
  Description: Accepts a numeric parameter referencing the month and returns the short string name of the Month, assumes correct input provided.

### short_name_to_month_number(month)
 	function/method to return month number when given short month name, assumes correct strings given
  
  Description: Accepts a string parameter referencing the short month name and returns numeric of the Month, assumes correct input provided.

### volume_of_a_cube(length)
	function/method to return volume of a cube, assumes numeric
  
  Description: Given the length of one side of the cube this as a numeric this returns the cube volume as a numeric.
  
### volume_of_a_sphere(radius)
	function/method to return volume of a sphere, assumes numeric, need clarification of accuracy required for answer and PI, assumed PI would be 22/7 and rounded to 1 digit
  
  Description: Given the radius of the sphere as a numeric this calculates the volume and returns it as a numeric, assumes accuracy only required to 1 decimal place and PI is 22/7 although this can be amended.
  
### fahrenheit_to_celsius(temperature_in_fahr)
	function/method to return degrees celcius when given fahrenheit, assumes numeric, need clarification of accuracy required

Description: Given the temperature in fahrenheit as a numeric this returns the numeric temperature conversion in degrees centigrade, assumes accuracy only required to 1 decimal place although this can be adjusted to suit.
